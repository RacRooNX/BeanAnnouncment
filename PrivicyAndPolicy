I am new at doing games but i will give my honest and best at this

Any private informacion is not sent to us we dont do anything with the info is come informacion is leaked we cannot sadly do annything about it.
We dont record voice chats or anything but moderators can hear you and can take actions about it if you dont follow the rules.
We use Photon servers currently when i am writing this we dont use playfab so theres no risk of your data being leaked.
Photon can only leak your Game ID it hackers can only block you for playing but just re-download it to play again.
If youu re-download the game maybe wont remember your cosmetics so you will lose them.

Thats all i can say stay safe out there BEAN! :)
